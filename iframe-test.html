      The graphs above include only UVA and community workers who live in the region, and who work 35 or more hours a week. As of 12/31/2021, a total of 15,111 people were employed by UVA and living in the region. Hover over the data points to see the number of employees represented in each percentage. UVA demographic data is self-reported; percentages in some graphs donâ€™t add to 100% because a) some employees did not disclose their demographic information and b) some racial groups were excluded to protect the anonymity of individuals in groups with small numbers. No UVA employees make less than $15 because UVA instituted a $15/hour minimum wage in 2019.
